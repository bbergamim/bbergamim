<h3>Hi, I’m Bruno Bergamim! ✌</h3>

I’m graduatted in Cumputer Sciences since 2012 and I work in Toyota Motors Corporation over 17 years as Production and Project Engineering Coordinator (last 5 years in this position) based in Indaiatuba/São Paulo - Brazil.

In my free hours, I work as a full-stack web developer and currently I have been studying Python and Machine Learning. 🤖

I’m always trying to learn something new in order to improve my developer skills and my self as a human being. 💪🧠
